## SuperStore Report

My first report created is a 2016 - 2019 Sales & Budget Report for the company SuperShop Store, a sample relational database with tables containing information such as Sales, Customers, Budget, Territories, Products, and a Calendar for the years 2016 - 2019.

## Data Cleaning

The first step to any practiced data analysis is data cleaning. With this database, the only data that had to be cleaned was in the Budget table. In the Excel file that the data originated from, the table included column names within the rows, Total Values, and the column headers as row values.

After this step, my second task was to map the relationships between the data tables (Sales & Budget) and the lookup tables (Customer, Product, Territories & Calendar). This step is crucial when working with relational databases, because without mapping keys between data tables and lookup tables, analyses would only be possible with independent tables.

## Reporting

The final part of my analysis came with creating my reporting dashboard/Report. I wanted to express my findings in a clearly communicative and interactive dashboard/Report, along with extra charts showing additional information, such as Sales by Product Category, Profit by Month, Profit by Region,  Profit by Category, Profit by Segment and Top Selling Products.

With Power BI, creating a dashboard/Report came very easily. I simply clicked which chart types I wanted and included the axes (Category, Subcategory, Month, etc.) as well as the data I wanted visualized (Sales, and Budget).
